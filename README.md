# Welcome to my programming-practices page :)
All the stuffs I created while learning about programming.

My end goal is to become an excellent software engineer.
I am starting with front-end development, then move to back-end (I'm still deciding which language I should begin with. If you happen to stumble upon my page and have suggestion, feel free to share it with me!). Maybe then I'll expand myself to learn about more sophisticated stuffs like cloud engineering, AI, and so on?
